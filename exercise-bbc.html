        <p>The Heads-Up machine will come into operation for the first time in Devon and Cornwall</p>
            <br>

        <p>Motorists under the influence of alcohol or drugs could be caught by a pioneering AI camera which is being tested for the first time in Devon and Cornwall.

            The state-of-the-art Heads-Up machine can detect road use and behaviour consistent with drivers who may be impaired by drink or drugs.
            
            Police further up the road can stop the vehicle, talk to the driver and do a roadside test for alcohol and illegal drugs.
            
            Geoff Collins, UK general manager of camera developer Acusensus, said: <blockquote>"We are delighted to be conducting the world's first trials of this technology right here in Devon and Cornwall."</blockquote>
            
            The camera can be moved quickly to any road in either county, without warning, with drivers unaware they have been spotted until police pull them over.
            
            <blockquote>"We are all safer if we can detect impairment before it causes an incident that could ruin lives,"</blockquote> said Mr Collins.
            
            Acusensus cameras have previously been used to help police catch drivers using mobile phones at the wheel or not wearing seatbelts.
            
            With drink-drivers six times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash, <strong><ins>Devon & Cornwall Police</ins></strong> are hoping the Heads-Up system will help to save lives.</p>

            <p>Supt Simon Jenkinson said his team polices 14,000 miles (22,530km) of road</p>
                <br>
            <p><blockquote>"Our officers cannot be everywhere,"</blockquote> said Supt Simon Jenkinson, whose team polices the 14,000 miles of roads in the two counties.

                <blockquote>"As members of the <strong><ins>Vision Zero South West</ins></strong> road safety partnership, we're committed to doing everything we can to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads."</blockquote>
                
                <blockquote>"Embracing emerging technology such as these cameras is vital in that quest."</blockquote>
                
                The trial is taking place throughout December to coincide with other drink-driving campaigns.
